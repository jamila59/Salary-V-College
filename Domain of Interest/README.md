## **Domain of Interest**
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in social media because now more than ever, we rely on the Internet to read and spread news. The rise of social media sites such as Buzzfeed, Facebook, and Instagram are starting to replace traditional forms of journalism and changing when or how we consume information. However, social media can lead to a lot of opportunities for the spread of misinformation, information overload, and a variety of other problems. All these factors can provide insight as to how we percieve and interact with the world around us.

**What other examples of data-driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
* [Twitter and COVID-19 Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/covid19-stream/overview ): This project started by Twitter aims to track tweets about COVID-19 in real time, allowing researchers to hopefully draw conclusions around online COVID conversation.

## **Find Data**
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:
*Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
* How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
* How many observations (rows) are in your data?
* How many features (columns) are in the data?
What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?



### **Dataset 1**
* Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

  * [data.world](https://data.world/afterschool/teen-fake-news-poll-on-after-school)
  
  
* How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

  * How are people’s perceptions of society influenced by what they see on social media?
  * How frequently are people exposed to misinformation via social media?
  * From this data, we can answer questions about how teenagers in the United States understand fake news. We can use this data to further discuss the relationships between fake new's knowledge and city, state, and student's response to fake news.

    * This dataset contains data on 3 million tweers sent from handles connected to the Internet Research Agency and a defendant in an indictment filed by the Justice Department 2018 as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The data was collected by Clemson Unviersity researchers Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren. They gathered the data using custom searches on a tool called Social Studio, owned by Salesforce and contracted for use by Clemson's Social Media Listening Center.

* How many observations (rows) are in your data?

    * 3 million

    * To what extent, if any, does social media influence political opinions?


### **Dataset 3**
* Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

  * [11,000+ Expanded & Coded Links from 36.5k IRA Troll Tweets](https://data.world/d1gi/11000-expanded-labeled-links-from-365k-troll-tweets)

    * The data was collected by NBC News on 2/14/18. It tracked 11k news links from Twitter troll accounts. This dataset helps to demonstrate how Russian propaganda efforts affected the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
